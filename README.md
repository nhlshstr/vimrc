# Vim Configuration File

My vim configuration file. Copy the text in the vimrc file to a hidden file .vimrc in your home direcotry so vim can recognize it, and you can get the same custom config settings.

May update the file with comments at some point but most of it is already there, and is otherwise self-explanatory or easily Googled.
